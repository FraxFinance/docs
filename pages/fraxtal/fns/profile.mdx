# Frax Name Reverse Resolution
## Overview
Reverse resolution is the process of mapping a blockchain address to a human-readable name. This functionality is essential within the Frax Name Service (FNS) as it transforms how addresses are displayed and recognized across various platforms. 
## Primary Name
In FNS, the primary name is the name that an address resolves to when reverse resolution is used. This name is set via the reverse registrar, a smart contract that allows users to register and manage their preferred primary name. Once set, the primary name is used across all applications and services that support FNS, ensuring that the ownerâ€™s identity is consistently and accurately represented.
