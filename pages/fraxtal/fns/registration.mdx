# Frax Name Registration
## Overview
The Frax Name Service (FNS) enables users to register and manage names under the .frax domain. Designed to function similarly to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), FNS provides a decentralized, secure way to link human-readable names to blockchain addresses and other decentralized identifiers within the Frax ecosystem. The payment method for FNS names is in FXS.
## Available Frax Names
All Frax Names with three or more characters are available for purchase through the FNS Registrar Controller. **Names with fewer than three characters are not available for registration.**

## Frax Name Ownership
Once registered, Frax Names are securely owned by the registrant during the registration period. Ownership grants full control over the name, including the ability to set up resolver records, transfer ownership, and renew the name. Before the registration expires, any address can extend the registration time for the current owner. After expiration, there is a 90-day grace period during which the previous owner can renew their name. If the name is not renewed within this grace period, it becomes available for anyone to register and claim ownership.

## Registration Prices
Registration prices for FNS names are calculated based on two factors:

* **Rent Price:** This is calculated linearly based on the registration period and the number of characters in the name.
* **Premium Price:** This additional cost is based on the rent price during the 90-day grace period. Owners who renew their names before expiration do not have to pay the premium price for the extended years.



### Rent Price
The table below outlines the annual rent prices based on the number of characters in the Frax Name:

| **Number of characters** |**One Year Rent** |
|:----------------------	|----------------:	|
|        **One**        	|        N/A      	|
| **Two** 	| N/A 	|
| **Three** 	| 1000 FXS |
| **Four** 	| 100 FXS |
| **Five** 	| 10 FXS 	|
| **Six or more** 	| 2 FXS	|
### Premeum Price
The premium price is calculated based on the rent price during the 90-day grace period:

$PremiumPrice = Rent Price \times 90 days$

## Frax Name Renewal
Frax Names must be renewed before expiration or within the 90-day grace period after expiration to maintain ownership.

## Frax Name Transfer
Ownership of a Frax Name can be transferred to another address at any time. This process is secure and ensures that the new owner receives full control over the name, including any associated records. Additionally, all records can be completely cleared before the transfer if desired.
