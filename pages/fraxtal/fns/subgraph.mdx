# FNS Subgraph

The FNS subgraph indexes on-chain events related to second-level .frax names, enabling us to create a comprehensive overview of the FNS names associated with an address. This subgraph is available on the [mainnet](https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/project_clsz4i0aqyt1001tgbtukfz17/subgraphs/fns-subgraph/0.0.1/gn). For further details, you can refer to the [ENS Subgraph Documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/web/subgraph).
