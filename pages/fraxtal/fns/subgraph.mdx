# FNS Subgraph

The FNS subgraph indexes on-chain events related to second-level .frax names, enabling us to create a comprehensive overview of the FNS names associated with an address. This subgraph is available on the [mainnet](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/yTuJVur5YbZxLfUkpbsScKADjZMchQ7EdxVxA3Djvs8?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one). For further details, you can refer to the [ENS Subgraph Documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/web/subgraph).
