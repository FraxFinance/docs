# Overview of Frax Name Service (FNS)

The Frax Name Service (FNS) is a fork of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), tailored to meet the specific needs of the Frax ecosystem. While FNS retains the core functionalities and underlying architecture of ENS, the primary enhancement introduced by FNS is its improved payment mechanism.

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized, open, and extensible naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables the mapping of human-readable names like 'alice.eth' to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and more. ENS also supports reverse resolution, allowing users to associate additional metadata with Ethereum addresses, such as primary names and interface descriptions.

Similarly, FNS maintains this foundational capability, allowing for the registration and management of Frax-specific names, with enhancements designed to better align with Frax’s economic model. This includes modifications to the payment methods used for name registration and renewal, leveraging Frax’s native assets to provide a more integrated user experience within the Frax ecosystem.
