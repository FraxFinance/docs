# FRAX on Fraxtal

Fraxtal leverages FRAX as the designated gas token, providing users with the capability to utilize FRAX to pay for blockspace.

Users can acquire FRAX on Fraxtal via the native L2 bridge by depositing FXS (ERC20) from Ethereum mainnet. When bridging FRAX back to Ethereum, users receive FXS (ERC20) after a 7-day withdrawal period.

Users can wrap their native FRAX on Fraxtal to receive WFRAX (an ERC20 representation). WFRAX is compatible with Frax Mesh, allowing seamless transfers of WFRAX to other integrated chains in the Frax ecosystem.
