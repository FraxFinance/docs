# Yapperboard FXTL Points

This extension of the **Flox Incentives System** rewards you with **FXTL points** for contributing high-quality content
to the community through **Yapperboard**.

<Callout type="info">
  To earn FXTL points via your Yapperboard rank, you need to register on
  [Kaito’s platform](https://yaps.kaito.ai/referral/407574068) and link your wallet address to your profile.
</Callout>

FXTL points are distributed weekly from a dedicated rewards pool.  
Your share depends on your **mindshare** — the higher your engagement and ranking in the
[weekly FRAX leaderboard](https://yaps.kaito.ai/frax), the more FXTL points you’ll receive.  
In short: better content and higher rankings mean greater rewards.

<Callout type="info">
  <strong>Retroactive allocation.</strong>
  
  If you earned FXTL points before linking your wallet, they will be queued. 
  After you link your wallet, those FXTL points are allocated the first time you appear on the weekly leaderboard again.
