## API3

[API3](https://api3.org) is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), the [API3 DAO](https://api3.org/dao).
API3 is building secure [first-party oracles](https://docs.api3.org/explore/introduction/first-party.html) and [OEV-enabled](https://docs.api3.org/explore/introduction/oracle-extractable-value.html) data feeds on Fraxtal. The data feeds are continuously updated by first-party oracles using signed data.

Unlike traditional data feeds, [OEV Network](https://docs.api3.org/explore/introduction/oracle-extractable-value.html) enables dApps using dAPIs to auction off the right to update the data feeds to searcher bots. Searcher bots can bid for price updates through the OEV Network to update the data feeds. All the OEV proceeds go back to the dApp.

Check out the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/fraxtal) to access 100+ dAPIs on Fraxtal.
