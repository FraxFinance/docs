## Tenderly Developer explorer

The Developer Explorer is a development toolbox designed to help developers effectively manage, debug, and monitor their Fraxtal projects. 

- Use the Developer Explorer to debug and simulate contracts with the integrated [Debugger](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=fraxtal), gaining insights to quickly identify and resolve issues. 
- Monitor deployed contracts and protocols on Fraxtal in real-time to ensure optimal performance and stability. 
- Set up critical [alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/intro-to-alerts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=fraxtal) on contracts to proactively respond to issues and improve security practices. Use [Alerts API](https://docs.tenderly.co/reference/api#/operations/createAlert?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=fraxtal) to set up custom alerts and configure granular triggering rules.
- Leverage Developer Explorer with [**Virtual TestNets**](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=fraxtal) during the entire dapp development process, from testing to staging and go-live. Utilize it for bug bounty programs for identifying vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security of your dapp.
