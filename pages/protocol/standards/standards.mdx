title: Frax Development Standards
lang: en-US
---

## General

### Repository

- Should utilize [`frax-template`](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-template) and [`frax-standard-solidity`](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-standard-solidity) to speed up and normalize development.
- Should pin dependencies to prevent breaks in future installs.

### Pull Requests

- Should receive one explicit approval for low-risk PRs, at least two approvals otherwise to reduce errors and promote collaboration.
- Should describe all notable changes within the description to support reviewers.
- Should only apply one feature/change per PR to simplify reviews.
- Should only contain commits by the author, unless a supporting PR is merged in, to prevent duplicate/overwritten work.

## Scripts

### Deploy/Upgrade

- Should generate the msig tx where needed using [SafeTxHelper](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-standard-solidity/blob/master/src/SafeTxHelper.sol), writing the tx to file, to provide replicable steps in msig operations.
- Should use minimal hardcoded addresses to reduce possibility of wrong addresses.
 - Should use either a Constants file or dynamic loading (via contract calls) where possible.
- Should define all variables as `public` to enable calling variables across tests.
- Should have the script command commented above the script to easily replicate if needed.
- Should have validation of state to further secure deployment.

### Tests

- Should incorporate the script to validate what is run.
- Should validate what is not covered in the script, creating full coverage.
- Should be pinned to a forked block to pass post-deployment.

## Upgrades

### General

- Should contain an updated `version()`, ie. "1.1.0" to track current contract version.
- Should inherit prior versions if possible to separate upgrade changes, simplifying reviews.
- Should add state through namespaced storage to protect state variables.
- Should mark all functions as `virtual` to support potential future overrides.
- Should inherit child contracts where possible to separate concerns.
- Should utilize `FraxUpgradeableProxy` or `FraxTransparentProxy` from `frax-standard-solidity` to maintain proxy standards across the org.

## Contracts

- Should balance simplicity with limited storage calls.
