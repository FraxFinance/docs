# Bug Bounty
Frax Finance provides one of the largest bounties in the industry for exploits where user funds are at risk or protocol controlled funds/collateral are at risk.

The bounty is simply calculated as the lower value of **10%** of the total possible exploit or $10m worth paid in frxUSD+FRAX (evenly split). Both tokens are immediately liquid. The bounty will be delivered immediately or a maximum turnaround time of 5 days due to timelock+mitigation. This bounty is a "no questions asked" policy for disclosures and/or immediate return of funds after any incident.

Slow arbitrage opportunities or value exchange over a prolonged period is not applicable to this bounty and will receive a base compensation bounty of 50,000 frxUSD.
Note: This bounty does not cover any front-end bugs/visual bugs or any type of server-side code of any web application that interacts with the Frax Protocol. The above bug bounty is only for smart contract code. Smart contract code on any chain that manages Frax Protocol value and/or user deposited value is included in this bounty.

This bounty applies to all smart contracts including Fraxswap AMM, Fraxlend, frxETH, FraxNet, Flox, FXB, and Hop.
