# FPIS Conversion / FPIS Locker
*Retiring FPIS and converting it to FXS*

Per the [Frax Singularity Roadmap Part 1](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-341-frax-singularity-roadmap-part-1/2987) vote, the community decided to eventually retire the FPIS token in the interest of focusing on FXS. On March 22, 2028, FPIS will be eligible for conversion to FXS at the ratio of 2.5 FPIS to 1 FXS. Until then, users may choose to lock their FPIS on Fraxtal using the [FPIS Locker](https://app.frax.finance/fpifpis/fpislocker). This will give the user 1.333x - 0.333x veFXS voting power based on the length of their lock. After the March 22, 2028 conversion date, positions that are still locked on the FPIS Locker can be converted to their FXS equivalent and rolled over into veFXS until the remaining lock time is completed, after which FXS can be withdrawn. FPIS that was never locked in the FPIS Locker or became unlocked before the conversion date may also be converted to FXS after the conversion date without having to go via the FPIS Locker. Users that have locked [veFPIS](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-price-index/vefpis) positions may now freely withdraw their FPIS.
