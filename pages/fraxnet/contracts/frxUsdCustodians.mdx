# FrxUSDCustodian

## Overview

`FrxUSDCustodian` is a **non-custodial mint/redeem contract** designed to maintain a 1:1 backing between `frxUSD` and a corresponding real-world asset (RWA) token or stablecoin, such as USDC, USDB, or USTB. It operates as an [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)-style vault but with added Frax-specific functionality and governance features.

Each instance of this contract holds reserves of a specific custodian token and allows users to deposit it to mint `frxUSD` or redeem `frxUSD` to withdraw the custodian token, subject to mint/redeem caps and fees.

It is designed to support regulatory compliance (e.g. with [Genius Act](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/07/us-treasury-releases-guidance-on-stablecoin-backing-rules/)) and can shuffle excess tokens into yield-bearing RWA issuers.

## Key Features

* ERC-4626-like vault with mint/redeem symmetry
* Fee controls for minting and redeeming
* Cap on the total `frxUSD` minted via this vault
* Conversion logic that handles differing decimals between frxUSD and the custodian token
* Restricted operator list for shuffling assets into yield strategies (e.g., RWA issuers)
* Optional slippage protection during RWA shuffle
* Admin-controlled upgrades, fees, and limits via `Ownable2Step`

## Initialization

```solidity
constructor(address _frxUSD, address _custodianTkn)
```

* Sets the immutable references to frxUSD and custodian token
* Retrieves and stores their decimals

```solidity
function initialize(address _owner, uint256 _mintCap, uint256 _mintFee, uint256 _redeemFee)
```

* One-time initialization function (guarded by `wasInitialized` flag)
* Sets owner, cap, and fees

| ----------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frxUSD`                | `FrxUSD`  | Reference to the frxUSD token (mintable/burnable)           |
| `custodianTkn`          | `IERC20`  | Backing asset held in custody for minted `frxUSD`                  |
| `mintCap`               | `uint256` | Maximum amount of `frxUSD` that can be minted               |
| `mintFee` / `redeemFee` | `uint256` | 18-decimal fixed-point fee rate                             |

## Core Functions

### Minting and Depositing

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) external returns (uint256 shares);
function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) external returns (uint256 assets);
```

* Mints frxUSD in exchange for the backing asset
* Subject to `mintCap` and `mintFee`

### Redeeming and Withdrawing

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256 shares);
function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256 assets);
```

* Redeems `frxUSD` for the underlying token, minus `redeemFee`

### Conversions and Previews

```solidity
function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256 shares);
function previewRedeem(uint256 shares) public view returns (uint256 assets);
```

* Computes expected mint/redeem amounts with fees and decimal adjustments

### Limits

```solidity
function maxMint(address) public view returns (uint256);
function maxWithdraw(address) public view returns (uint256);
```

* Enforces mint cap and ensures vault solvency

### RWA Shuffle

```solidity
function shuffleToRwa(uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountRwaOut) public;
```

* Allows approved bots to move idle custodian tokens to RWA issuers for yield
* Enforces slippage bounds and post-shuffle minimum balance

## Events

| Name                        | Description                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Deposit` / `Withdraw`      | Minting and redeeming lifecycle events    |
| `MintCapSet`                | Emitted when the cap is adjusted          |
| `OperatorStatusSet`         | Admin toggles an operator's permission    |
| `custodianTknShuffledToRwa` | Tokens sent to RWA issuer                 |
| `MinAmountAfterShuffleSet`  | Update to minimum reserve after shuffling |

## Access Control

* Inherits `Ownable2Step` for safe admin transfer
* Only the owner can:

  * Adjust fees, cap, operator list
  * Call `setMinAfterShuffle`
  * Recover tokens or perform upgrades

## Usage in Frax

Each `FrxUSDCustodian` contract is paired 1:1 with a specific backing asset. Examples:

* [`frxUSD-USDC Custodian`](#) holds USDC
* [`frxUSD-USDB Custodian`](#) holds USDB

Together, they allow `frxUSD` to be dynamically minted and redeemed against multiple real-world backed assets, while ensuring compliance, solvency, and flexibility for revenue-generating strategies.
