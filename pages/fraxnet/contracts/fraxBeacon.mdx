# FraxBeacon

## Overview

`FraxBeacon` is an **upgradable beacon** used within the Frax Finance ecosystem to manage implementation addresses for Beacon Proxy deployments. It allows a factory contract to deploy minimal proxies (Beacon Proxies) that forward calls to the address specified by the beacon’s `implementation()` function.

This architecture enables **centralized upgradeability** for multiple proxy contracts through a single control point.

It follows the [EIP-1967 Beacon Proxy Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967) and is **Ownable2Step**, providing a safe ownership transfer process.

## Key Features

- Central upgradeability point for all beacon-based FraxNet contracts
- Ownable2Step for secure admin transitions
- Emits event on upgrades for auditability
- Used by the `FraxNetDepositFactory` to deploy all `FraxNetDeposit` contracts

## Initialization

```solidity
constructor(address _owner, address _initialImplementation)
```

- Sets the owner (admin) and the initial logic contract.
- Can only be called once during deployment.

## State Variables

| Name             | Type      | Description                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `implementation` | `address` | The address of the current logic contract that proxies will delegate to |

## Functions

### `implementation() → address`

```solidity
function implementation() external view override returns (address)
```

- Returns the current implementation contract.
- Used by proxies to resolve the target for delegated calls.

### `setImplementation(address _newImplementation)`

```solidity
function setImplementation(address _newImplementation) external onlyOwner
```

- Admin-only function to update the implementation address.
- Emits `FraxBeaconImplementationUpdated`.

### `_setImplementation(address _newImplementation)`

```solidity
function _setImplementation(address _newImplementation) internal
```

- Internal logic to update and emit event.
- Called during construction and upgrade.

## Events

| Name                              | Description                                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `FraxBeaconImplementationUpdated` | Emitted when the implementation address is changed. |

```solidity
event FraxBeaconImplementationUpdated(address oldImplementation, address newImplementation);
```

## Access Control

- The contract inherits from `Ownable2Step`.
- Only the current owner can call `setImplementation`.
- Ownership transfers require two steps: `transferOwnership` and `acceptOwnership`.

## Usage in Frax

The `FraxBeacon` is primarily used by:

- `FraxNetDepositFactory` to manage the upgrade path for deployed `FraxNetDeposit` contracts.
- Enables **upgrading logic** of all `FraxNetDeposit` instances by updating this single beacon.
- Ensures that new deployments and existing proxies always reference the latest logic contract.

## Notes

- Updating the beacon will immediately affect all proxies tied to it.
- Ensures scalable and gas-efficient management of upgradable contracts.
- No initialization function is required—parameters are passed via constructor.
