## Proxy Architecture

FraxNet Deposit contracts are built using an upgradeable proxy architecture to ensure long-term flexibility, security, and compliance. This design allows the core logic of the contracts to be upgraded without changing the contract addresses that users and integrators interact with. By separating the implementation (logic) from the proxy (state and interface), the Frax team can deploy improvements, fix bugs, or adapt to evolving regulatory requirements—such as Genius Act compliance for custodians—without disrupting existing integrations or user experience.
