# FraxZero Overview

FraxZero is Frax's cross-chain infrastructure that enables seamless asset movement and liquidity. Built on a robust hub-and-spoke architecture, FraxZero provides users with flexibility to interact with **frxUSD** and **other Frax assets** across **20+ blockchain networks**.

## Core Architecture

### Hub and Spoke Model

FraxZero operates on a hub-and-spoke architecture where **Fraxtal**, Frax's native L1 EVM chain, serves as the central hub for all cross-chain operations. This design ensures:

- **Centralized Liquidity Management**: All bridged assets are routed through the Fraxtal Hub
- **Efficient Asset Routing**: Optimized paths between [any supported chain](/frxusd/fraxzero-supported-networks) for 1:1 cross-chain transfers
- **Unified Security Model**: Consistent security standards across all connected networks

### Multi-Chain Asset Support

FraxZero supports 6 Frax assets across 20+ blockchain networks, including:

- **frxUSD** - Frax's stablecoin
- **sfrxUSD** - Frax's yield-bearing stablecoin
- **WFRAX** - Frax's wrapped governance token
- **frxETH** - Frax's liquid staking derivative
- **sfrxETH** - Frax's staked liquid staking derivative
- **FPI** - Frax's price index stablecoin

## Key Features

### Dual Lockbox System

FraxZero implements a dual lockbox mechanism that:

- **Unlocks Native Liquidity**: Provides access to native Frax assets on multiple chains
- **Enhanced Security**: Multiple security layers protect user assets during cross-chain transfers
- **Instant Availability**: Assets are immediately available as native tokens on destination chains

### Flexible Security Model

The platform features a **3 of 3 Data Validation Network (DVN) requirement** that includes:

- **Frax Team-Run DVN**: Direct oversight from Frax's security team
- **Multi-Party Validation**: Distributed security across multiple validation networks
- **Configurable Requirements**: Adaptable security parameters based on asset type and transfer size

FraxZero enables seamless asset swapping across chains with:

- **Fraxtal Liquidity Access**: Users can access Fraxtal's deep liquidity from [any supported chain](/frxusd/fraxzero-supported-networks)
