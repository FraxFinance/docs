# Mint & Redeem frxUSD Overview

frxUSD can be minted and redeemed through multiple pathways, offering users flexibility in how they access and utilize the stablecoin. This overview covers the main minting and redemption methods available.

## Traditional Minting & Redeeming

### Single-Chain Operations

The most straightforward way to mint and redeem frxUSD is through direct interaction with the protocol on a single blockchain network. This method is ideal for users who want to:

- **Mint frxUSD**: Convert supported assets (USDC, USDB, or tokenized treasuries like BUIDL, USTB, WisdomTree) into frxUSD at a 1:1 ratio
- **Redeem frxUSD**: Convert frxUSD back to the underlying backing assets
- **Earn yields**: Hold frxUSD to earn 4.1% APY from Treasury yields

### Supported Assets for Minting

frxUSD can be minted using any of these assets:

- **Stablecoins**: USDC, USDB
- **Tokenized Treasuries**: BUIDL (BlackRock), USTB (Superstate), WisdomTree Government Money Market Fund

### How It Works

1. **Approve your asset** for the frxUSD minting contract
2. **Deposit your asset** to mint frxUSD at a 1:1 ratio
3. **Hold frxUSD** to earn Treasury yields automatically via [FraxNet](https://net.frax.com)
4. **Redeem anytime** by converting frxUSD back to your chosen asset

## Cross-Chain Minting & Redeeming with FraxNet

### Overview

FraxNet introduces a cross-chain infrastructure that enables users to mint frxUSD on one blockchain while using assets from another. This system leverages FraxZero technology and specialized smart contracts to provide seamless cross-chain functionality.

### Key Benefits

- **Asset Flexibility**: Use USDC from Ethereum to mint frxUSD on Base, Arbitrum, or other supported networks
- **Gas Optimization**: Choose the most cost-effective network for your operations
- **Unified Experience**: Manage cross-chain operations through a single interface
- **Institutional Grade**: Built on proven cross-chain messaging protocols

### How Cross-Chain Minting Works

The FraxNet system operates through a sophisticated contract architecture:

1. **Contract Deployment**: Each user deploys a personalized FraxNet deposit contract via the factory on Ethereum mainnet
2. **Asset Transfer**: Transfer USDC (or other supported assets) directly to your deployed FraxNet contract
3. **Cross-Chain Minting**: The system processes your deposit and mints frxUSD on your chosen destination chain
4. **Recipient Control**: Specify exactly which address on which chain will receive the minted frxUSD

### How Cross-Chain Redemption Works

The redemption process reverses the minting flow:

1. **Cross-Chain Transfer**: Send frxUSD from the destination chain back to your FraxNet contract on Ethereum
2. **Asset Conversion**: Call `processRedemption` to convert frxUSD back to USDC
3. **Asset Delivery**: Receive USDC directly to your specified address on Ethereum

### Supported Networks

FraxNet currently supports cross-chain operations between:

- **Ethereum Mainnet** (deployment and asset source)
- **Base Mainnet** (frxUSD destination)
- **Arbitrum** (frxUSD destination)
- **Polygon** (frxUSD destination)
- **Solana** (frxUSD destination with special address formatting)

## Choosing Your Minting & Redeeming Method

### Use Traditional Minting When:

- You want to mint/redeem on the same network
- You prefer the simplest possible user experience
- You're working with smaller amounts where gas costs aren't a major concern
- You want immediate access to Treasury yields

### Use FraxNet Cross-Chain When:

- You want to mint frxUSD on a network with lower gas fees
- You need to bridge assets between different blockchain ecosystems
- You're working with larger amounts where gas optimization matters
- You want to leverage specific DeFi opportunities on different networks
- You need to serve users across multiple blockchain networks

## Technical Requirements

### For Traditional Minting:

- Gas tokens for the network you're operating on
- Supported assets (USDC, USDB, or tokenized treasuries)
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)

### For FraxNet Cross-Chain:

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: ETH for contract deployment and operations
- **Destination Chain**: ETH (or native gas token) for receiving and using frxUSD
- **Supported Assets**: USDC or other approved assets on Ethereum mainnet
- **Contract Deployment**: One-time deployment of your personal FraxNet contract

## Security & Transparency

### Traditional Operations

- Direct interaction with audited smart contracts
- Real-time reserve verification through transparency reports
- Institutional-grade custody backing all frxUSD

### FraxNet Cross-Chain

- FraxZero's proven cross-chain messaging protocol
- Personalized contract deployment for enhanced security
- Same institutional backing and transparency standards
- Regular security audits and monitoring
