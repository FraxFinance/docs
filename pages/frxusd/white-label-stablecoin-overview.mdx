# White-label Stablecoins Overview

Build and launch your own branded stablecoin with frxUSD as the underlying backing asset. White-label stablecoins allow businesses, platforms, and organizations to create customized stablecoin solutions while leveraging the proven stability and security of the Frax ecosystem.

## What are White-label Stablecoins?

White-label stablecoins are customizable stablecoin solutions that you can brand and deploy under your own name, while maintaining the same stability guarantees as frxUSD. This approach gives you:
